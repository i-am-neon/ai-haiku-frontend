Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, ModernHuman LLC grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (“Commercial Use”). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of AI Haikus generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each. AI Haiku owner’s rights to display the Art for their AI Haiku to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of AI Haikus generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each AI Haiku owner’s rights to display the Art for their AI Haiku to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased AI Haiku leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</li>

(ii) Non-digital Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use, copy, and display the Art for your Purchased AI Haiku for the purpose of commercializing your own physical merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased AI Haiku (“Commercial Use”), provided that such Commercial Use does not (a) include any form of collaboration or involvement of any brand or other third party, or (b) result in you earning more than USD$100,000 in gross revenue each year. In the event your Commercial Use exceeds USD$100,000 in a given year, you will need to enter into a commercial license with us. If you exceed the USD$100,000 limitation, you will be in breach of these Terms, and must contact us regarding entering into a broader license agreement (which will be in our sole and absolute discretion). Without entering into a commercial license with us, you acknowledge and agree that: (x) you are in breach of these Terms; (y) in addition to any remedies that may be available to us at law or in equity, we may immediately terminate the license granted above; and (z) you will be liable and responsible to reimburse us for any costs and expenses incurred by us during the course of enforcing these Terms against you (including attorney and legal fees).</li>
                        <li>Restrictions. You agree that you may not, nor permit any third party to do or attempt to do any of the foregoing without our express prior written consent in each case: (i) modify the Art for your Purchased AI Haikus in any way, including, without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes; (ii) use the Art for your Purchased AI Haikus to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (iii) use the Art for your Purchased AI Haikus in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to incite violence or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (iv) use the Art for your Purchased AI Haikus in movies, videos, or any other forms of media, except to the limited extent that such use is expressly permitted in these Terms or solely for your own personal, non-commercial use; (v) sell, distribute for commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Art for your Purchased AI Haikus, except as expressly permitted in these Terms; (vi) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional intellectual property rights in or to the Art for your Purchased AI Haikus; or (vii) otherwise utilize the Art for your Purchased AI Haikus for your or any third party’s commercial benefit.

                    <b>RISKS.</b> You accept and acknowledge the following risks: (a) The prices of blockchain assets and cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and adversely affect the value of your AI Haikus, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. We cannot guarantee that any AI Haikus purchased will retain their original value. AI Haikus have no inherent or intrinsic value. For the avoidance of doubt, your purchase of AI Haikus should not be considered an investment. (b) You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, taxes apply to your AI Haiku-related transactions. We are not responsible for determining the taxes that apply to any of your transactions. (c) The App does not store, send, or receive AI Haikus. AI Haikus exist only by virtue of the ownership record maintained on the blockchain in the Ethereum network. Any transfer of AI Haikus occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network. (d) There are risks associated with using an Internet-based currency, including, but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that we will not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience when using the Ethereum network, however caused. (e) A lack of use or public interest in the creation and development of distributed ecosystems could negatively impact the AI Haikus and, including but not limited to, the value of the AI Haikus. (f) The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, and tokens is highly uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the AI Haikus, and therefore the potential value of AI Haikus. (g) Upgrades by Ethereum to the Ethereum network, a hard fork in the Ethereum network, or a change in how transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum network may have unintended, adverse effects on all blockchains using the Ethereum NFT Metaplex standard, including the AI Haikus.

The prevailing party in any arbitration or other proceeding arising under these Terms shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees, expert-witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection with the proceeding. Judgment on the award may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the above, each party shall have the right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a final decision by the arbitrator. For the purposes of this Agreement, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the United States Federal Courts or state courts located in Texas.

Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of our right to later enforce that or any other part of these Terms. For any waiver of compliance with these Terms to be binding on us, one of our authorized representatives must provide you with written notice of that waiver. There are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms. Nothing in these Terms create any agency, partnership, or joint venture. The language in these Terms will be interpreted as to its fair meaning, and not strictly for or against any party. You may not assign any or your rights or obligations under these Terms, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign our rights and obligations under these Terms in our sole discretion to an affiliate, or in connection with an acquisition, sale or merger. These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas, and the federal laws of United States applicable therein, excluding its conflicts of law rules and principles. Subject to Section 12, any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms will be brought exclusively in the State or Federal courts located in Texas and the parties irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction and venue there. We shall not be liable for any failure to perform our obligations here where such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control, including without limitation mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including “line-noise” interference). All notices under these Terms shall be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or registered mail, return-receipt requested; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or email; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next-day delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.
